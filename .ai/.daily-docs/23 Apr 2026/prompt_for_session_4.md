## Session Onboarding — court-fitness (Session 4, Sprint 01 Session 3)

You are picking up work on **court-fitness** — a mobile-first PWA for tennis coaches to plan weekly training for their players, with both sides logging actual session results. It lives at `C:\xampp\htdocs\court-fitness` on Windows 11 XAMPP. Production URL: `https://fitness.hitcourt.com`.

This is a long-horizon project under a strict AI Agent Framework. Before you do ANYTHING, read these docs **in order**:

1. `.ai/.ai-agent-framework/AI_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md` — operating constitution. Sealed. Read-only.
2. `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) — project-specific conventions. Sections 3 + 4 especially.
3. `.ai/README.md` — folder map.
4. `.ai/.ai2/BRIEFING.md` — 1-page project overview.
5. `.ai/.ai2/WIP.md` — current state. Has "In scope — NOT DONE" for Session 4.
6. `.ai/.ai2/SESSION_LOG.md` — project diary (3 rows now).
7. `.ai/.ai2/HARD_LESSONS.md` — eleven entries (HL-1..HL-11). Read all.
8. `.ai/.ai2/SEALED_FILES.md`.
9. `.ai/.ai2/KNOWN_ERRORS.md` (still empty with template).
10. `.ai/.ai2/ltat-fitness-findings.md` — predecessor findings.
11. `.ai/sprints/sprint-01/sprint-plan.md` — **your playbook.** Especially §3 (schema, now implemented) and §5 (UI screens — the meat of Session 4+).
12. `.ai/.daily-docs/23 Apr 2026/session_3_handover.md` — what happened last session.

After reading, DO NOT touch code yet. Run the **Framework Conformance Check** (Appendix D of AI_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md) in chat. Wait for Rajat's "proceed."

## Context

Sprint 01 Session 3 (last session) shipped a **working vertical slice**: DB migrated + seeded, SSO validates + upserts + role-redirects, Player Dashboard renders with orange branding and real demo plan data. Log in as any demo user via the dev stub SSO and see the dashboard on a phone-width layout.

**What Session 4 builds:** the Coach side. Specifically: `My Players`, `My Plans`, and the big hard one — the **Plan Builder** mobile screen. Plus a Plan Detail view for the Player side (so tapping a plan card actually goes somewhere).

**Tech stack (summary):** PHP 8.2.12 / CodeIgniter 4.7.2 / MySQL 8.0+ / Bootstrap 5 (not yet loaded — next session might pull it in, or we stay pure custom CSS — your call). Brand: `#F26522` orange. Full detail: `CLAUDE.md` §7.

## What Was Done Last Session (Session 3, 2026-04-23)

1. DB created, 3 migrations applied, 204-row exercise catalogue seeded from ltat_fitness SQL dump (commit `2140d87`).
2. Complete SSO flow — JWT validation → user upsert → session → role-based redirect (coach/player/admin-placeholder).
3. Dev stub SSO harness: `http://localhost:8080/dev` shows one-click login buttons for 4 demo users.
4. Mobile-first Player Dashboard renders Rohan's demo plan with orange header, training target chip, coach name, exercise count, progress bar.
5. Coach Dashboard stub + Admin "coming soon" placeholder.
6. Global CSS at `public/assets/css/court-fitness.css` with CSS custom properties (`--cf-primary` etc.), 44px tap targets, grid adapts to tablet+.

Demo-ready URLs:
- `/dev` — stub SSO landing
- `/dev/sso-stub?as=player` — log in as Rohan (player)
- `/dev/sso-stub?as=coach` — log in as Rajat (coach)
- `/dev/sso-stub?as=admin` — admin placeholder

## What Needs To Be Done Now (Session 4, Sprint 01 Session 3)

In priority order:

1. **AuthFilter.** New class `app/Filters/AuthFilter.php`. Checks `session('is_authenticated')`; if missing, 302 to `${HITCOURT_BASE_URL}/login?return=<requested_path>` (env var already set). Register in `Config/Filters.php` with `$globals` pre-filter, EXEMPT these routes: `/`, `/sso`, and in dev also `/dev` + `/dev/sso-stub`. Write at least 1 unit test (a request without session cookie returns 302 to HitCourt).

2. **Player Plan Detail screen.** Route `GET /player/plans/{id}` — new controller `Player\Plans::show($planId)`. Loads the plan + its entries joined with fitness_subcategories names, groups by date → session_period. Mobile-first view: each day is a section, each session period is a sub-section, each exercise is a card showing type/category/subcategory + `target_json` nicely formatted + "Log actuals" button (leads to Session 5's Log Actuals screen).

3. **Coach My Players screen.** Route `GET /coach/players` → `Coach\Players::index`. Shows all players assigned to the logged-in coach (JOIN coach_player_assignments + users). Search-by-first-3-letters (client-side JS or server-side). "Add Player" button — leads to an inline form OR a modal — lets the coach register a new player with email/first_name/family_name. NB: this creates a court-fitness local `users` row with an arbitrary `hitcourt_user_id` (negative or prefixed) until the player actually SSOs in later — design decision you make.

4. **Coach My Plans screen.** Route `GET /coach/plans` → `Coach\Plans::index`. Filter chips: Weekof, Player. List of plan cards, FAB for "New Plan."

5. **Coach Plan Builder — the hard mobile screen.** Route `GET /coach/plans/new` (or `/coach/plans/{id}/edit` for existing). This is where you earn your pay:
   - Top form: player (dropdown from assigned list), week_of (Monday picker), training target (combobox: dropdown of 7 suggestions + "Add More" that opens a 100-char text input), weight unit (kg/lb).
   - Per-day accordion: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun. Tap to expand.
   - Inside each day: three tabs or cards for morning / afternoon / evening.
   - Inside each session: list of added exercises + "Add exercise" button that opens a bottom-sheet with the 3-level drilldown (exercise_type → fitness_category → fitness_subcategory).
   - For each exercise added: fields matching exercise_type (Cardio = max_hr_pct, duration_min; Weights = sets, reps, weight, rest_sec; Agility = reps + rest_sec). Store in `target_json`.
   - Save button persists the full plan + entries.
   - Form validation: week_of must be a Monday (server-side check); training_target length 1-100.

6. **Stretch — if time:** Player Log Actuals screen, PWA manifest, simple session-cookie-backed "remember me."

Session 4 likely gets through items 1-4 cleanly; item 5 might span into Session 5.

## Open Questions for Rajat (ASK at session open if not already addressed)

1. **New-player creation in Coach My Players** — when the coach adds a brand-new player who doesn't yet exist in HitCourt, what's the right behaviour? Options: (a) create a court-fitness-only stub user with a placeholder hitcourt_user_id, (b) forbid adding until the player registers on HitCourt first, (c) send an invite email (needs email infrastructure). My default if no answer: (a) with hitcourt_user_id = -1 (or prefixed "pending:<email>"), to be reconciled when the real user SSOs in.
2. **URL pattern for plan IDs** — Sprint 01 plan flagged this. Default: plain CI4 (`/coach/plans/42`, `/player/plans/42`). If Rajat wants the ltat_fitness base64-obfuscated style, tell me.
3. **Bootstrap 5 or pure custom CSS** — Session 3 stayed pure custom. Plan Builder's accordion + bottom-sheet will be more work without a framework. Propose: pull in Bootstrap 5 now (just for components; we keep our CSS variables for branding). Rajat's call.

Each has a default if you don't answer before I start coding.

## Key Conventions (quick reference — full in CLAUDE.md)

- **Foreign keys ARE used.** Engineering decision (HL-6).
- **ONE migrations folder.** If tempted to apply raw SQL because a migration fights you, STOP (HL-1).
- **Plain English with Rajat.** He is a Vibe-Coder. No jargon without definition.
- **Captain / Engine Engineer model.** Technical decisions within scope are yours by default — make them, explain, move on. Product / scope / priority is his.
- **Mobile-first UI, non-negotiable.** Every screen passes the 5-inch phone test before desktop is considered.
- **Commit per logical unit.** Typical Session 4 commits: AuthFilter + tests → Player Plan Detail → Coach My Players → Coach My Plans → Plan Builder skeleton.
- **No `--amend`, no `--force`, no `--no-verify`.**
- **Sealed:** `.ai/.ai-agent-framework/AI_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md`. Never modify.
- **Six session-close artifacts** mandatory at close. Begin close at 70% context.

## Verification Commands

End-of-Session-4 targets:

```bash
cd C:/xampp/htdocs/court-fitness

# Tests: AuthFilter test added on top of existing 10
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/                        # all pass

# Server + end-to-end demo flow
php spark serve --port 8080                              # background
# As player — tap plan card reaches Plan Detail (not 404 anymore)
curl -sL -c c.txt -b c.txt "http://localhost:8080/dev/sso-stub?as=player"       # lands on dashboard
# Then: curl the plan detail URL with cookies → renders
# As coach — My Players + My Plans + Plan Builder all render without 500s
curl -sL -c c.txt -b c.txt "http://localhost:8080/dev/sso-stub?as=coach"        # lands on coach dashboard
# Manually: browse /coach/players, /coach/plans, /coach/plans/new and verify each mobile layout

# Unauthenticated → AuthFilter → 302 to HitCourt
curl -sI "http://localhost:8080/coach"                   # 302 to hitcourt login URL

git status                                               # clean at session close
git log --oneline -10                                    # ≥ 3 meaningful commits this session
```

## Known Risks (descending likelihood)

1. **Plan Builder mobile UX.** The hardest screen. ltat-fitness's desktop form has ~10 columns side-by-side — cannot translate to a phone. Design the accordion → bottom-sheet drilldown carefully. Over-invest here; this is what stakeholders judge the product on.
2. **AuthFilter + dev stub SSO interaction.** Filter must exempt `/sso`, `/dev`, `/dev/sso-stub`, and `/` (the CI4 welcome page). Getting this wrong creates an infinite redirect loop OR blocks SSO login. Test carefully.
3. **JSON shape for `target_json` per exercise type.** Cardio, Weights, Agility each want different fields. Either branch in the Plan Builder UI or use a flexible dynamic form. Document the JSON shapes in a new doc (`.ai/.ai2/exercise_json_shapes.md` is a reasonable place).
4. **Session cookie persistence through a POST form submit.** The Plan Builder will POST — make sure CSRF tokens are configured (CI4 has built-in support; check `Config/Security.php`).

## When In Doubt

- Unclear requirement → ask Rajat (Rule 9).
- Unclear past decision → `.ai/.ai2/HARD_LESSONS.md` + the Session 3 handover.
- Tempted by destructive git op → do not.
- Tempted by "while I'm here, let me also…" → log in WIP.md follow-ups, do not do it (Rule 7).
- Tempted to apply raw SQL because a migration fights you → STOP (HL-1).
- Tempted to mock a role check "just to unblock" → NEVER (HL-8).

Good luck. Run the Framework Conformance Check, wait for "proceed," build the Coach side.
